# Optimized Prewitt Edge Detection with CUDA

## Overview
This project implements an optimized version of the Prewitt edge detection algorithm using CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) for parallel processing on NVIDIA GPUs. The Prewitt edge detection operator is commonly used in image processing to detect edges in digital images.

## Features
- Utilizes CUDA for parallel processing on NVIDIA GPUs, enabling significant performance improvements over CPU-based implementations.
- Implements the Prewitt edge detection algorithm, which is efficient and widely used for detecting edges in images.
- Optimized for performance and scalability to handle large image datasets efficiently.

## Requirements
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA Toolkit installed
- OpenCV (for image input/output)
